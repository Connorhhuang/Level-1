# Level-1
One-week final project for CMU's CS112, done with a restricted version of Tkinter that was used during the class. This package is not built for game graphics, so performance may be slightly choppy.
Just running Level1.py will bring up the main menu of the game, displaying the objective and in-game controls. From this menu, you can either click the PLAY button to start the game, or press the "b" key to toggle showing the full generated map. Pressing the "n" key toggles the partitions that were used to create the rooms. As always, you can press the "r" key to re-generate a new map.
In game, the two dev commands are "~" or "SHIFT+`" on my keyboard to toggle invincibility, and "`" to teleport to the boss room.
All enemies can be defeated by making them hit each other, deflecting their projectiles, or pushing them into the "spikes", the red fields scattered across the map. Melee enemies in particular can be defeated by making them dash into walls or "spikes".
